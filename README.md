Python program to track inferno splits and find averages and more for runs

To use add folder path of txt file location 

Things to add:
- how many clears of zuk vs attempts i have
- filter through different runs based on dates, times cleared (exclude runs over 50 mins? etc.)
- Remove the line that prints each split ? Not really needed? waste of space when running program
- Rename variables make all into snakecase
